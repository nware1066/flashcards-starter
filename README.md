# Project FlashCard
## Solo project by Naomi Ware
Turing's 2005 Mod 2, week 1 project.


This project was a Solo project completed during the first week of Turings Mod 2. It was completed entirely in JavaScript, with no user interface, as it is only intended to run in the Command Line Interface.


The app allows a user to take a quiz on a given subject (JavaScript prototypes in this case), with multiple choice answers and immediate feedback to indicate if the user selected the correct answer. When all of the cards have been used, a message with the percentage of correct answers will display.


### Here is what the app looks like in action:

To run the app, clone it into your command line, and then enter `index node.js`. You will see a welcome message and the first question with a group of possible answers. Enter the number for your answer and press the enter key. The app will let you know if you got the correct answer, and then supply the next question until you have run through the entire deck. You will then be told what percentage of the questions you answered correctly.

Good Luck!
