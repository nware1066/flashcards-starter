# Project FlashCard
## Solo project by Naomi Ware
Turing's 2005 Mod 2, week 1 project.

### Project Overview

You can find this project at: https://github.com/nware1066/flashcards-starter

This project was a Solo project completed during the first week of Turings Mod 2. It was completed entirely in JavaScript, with no user interface, as it is only intended to run in the Command Line Interface.

This project was my first experience with Test Driven Design, and I used the Mocha test framework and the Chai assertion library for Node JS.

In order for the app to function as expected, some helper functions were provided by the instructors, and those methods were not tested for. All of the methods created by me have tests that were written prior to writing the methods themselves.

The app allows a user to take a quiz on a given subject (JavaScript prototypes in this case), with multiple choice answers and immediate feedback to indicate if the user selected the correct answer. When all of the cards have been used, a message with the percentage of correct answers will display.

### Learning Goals

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Wins

- I was able to successfully write tests for each property and method.
- I writing tests prior to code allowed me to break work down into smaller steps, which made the work much easier.
- I now have a working, useful tool to help me study for my exams.

### Challenges

- Learning to use the linter was a bit frustrating, since I am not used to using one. I will definitely use it as I work from this point forward, instead of waiting until the end of the project.
- Deciding what to test for and how many tests to write is challenging, and something that I will be working on as I learn.
- finding ways to test the game without invoking the game repeatedly
was definitely a challenge, which I solved by using a helper function.
